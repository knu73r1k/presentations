# DevX - Developer eXperience
<br><br>

>Developer experience refers to how easy or difficult it is for a developer to perform essential tasks needed to implement a change. A positive developer experience would mean these tasks are relatively easy for the team.

# CDE - Cloud Development Enivronments

CDEs value the following principles:

* Ephemeral over long lived
  - A fresh disposable environment for every task
* Reproducible over cobbled together
  - Consistently replicable without manual intervention
* Effortless over arduous
  - With minimal friction and difficulty
* Abundant over scarce
  - Instantaneously obtainable, seemingly infinite

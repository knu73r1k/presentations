# CDE - Cloud Development Enivronments

CDEs value the following principles:

* Ephemeral over long lived
  - A fresh disposable environment for every task
* Reproducible over cobbled together
  - Consistently replicable without manual intervention
* Effortless over arduous
  - With minimal friction and difficulty.
* Abundant over scarce
  - Instantaneously obtainable, seemingly infinite.
